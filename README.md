# Profits and Revenue KPI dashboards for East Side Deli Market

### Summary
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple visualization of various profits and revenue KPI's for a local grocery store and deli, East Side Deli Market.
Over the course of eight months we analyzed various financial factors: including profits and revenue monthly trend lines, and profits and revenue growth rate trends. 
This business began to accept foodstamps on September and we analyze the effect of foodstamps on daily sales and monthly profits, and whether this effect was statistically significant. 
Visualizations of this analysis were created on Tableau.
